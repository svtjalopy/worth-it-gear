  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>At WorthItGear, we take your privacy seriously. This page explains what data we collect, how it’s used, and how we keep it secure.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect basic analytics information such as pages visited, browser type, and general location (city/state) using standard tools like Google Analytics. This helps us improve the site and understand what content is most helpful to visitors.</p>

  <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
  <p>Some of the links on this site are affiliate links. That means if you click one and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission — at no extra cost to you. These commissions help support the work we do and keep the site running.</p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>We may use cookies to track general usage patterns and affiliate activity. You can disable cookies through your browser settings if you prefer not to allow them.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Tools</h2>
  <p>We may use trusted third-party tools to analyze site usage or track affiliate performance. These tools have their own privacy policies and do not give us access to your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this policy or how your information is used, feel free to reach out through our <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p>
